The bull's-eye prioritizes security efforts based on the criticality and accessibility of assets.


*   **Applications (Inner Circle - Bull's-eye):** This is the core and most critical layer. Applications are what users directly interact with and where data is created, processed, and stored. Therefore, they are the most frequent target of attacks. Securing applications is the highest priority. Examples include web applications, databases, and custom software.

*   **Systems (Second Circle):** This layer encompasses the operating systems and supporting infrastructure that host the applications. If an attacker compromises a system, they can potentially gain access to all the applications running on it. Thus, securing systems (e.g., hardening operating systems, patching vulnerabilities) is the next priority.

*   **Networks (Third Circle):** This layer represents the network infrastructure that connects systems and allows communication. Network security measures (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, VPNs) aim to control access to systems and prevent unauthorized network traffic. Securing the network is important, but it's less critical than securing the systems and applications themselves because a breach can be contained if those inner layers are strong.

*   **Policies (Outer Circle):** This is the outermost layer and represents the overarching security policies, procedures, and guidelines that govern the organization's security practices. Policies provide the framework for all other security efforts. While essential, they are the least direct defense against immediate attacks. Policies define how applications, systems, and networks *should* be secured, but they don't directly prevent intrusions.

**Key Takeaway:**

This model emphasizes a layered security approach, also known as "defense in depth." The idea is that if one layer is breached, other layers will still provide protection. It also highlights that the most important and vulnerable assets (applications) should receive the most immediate and focused security attention.

**Example:**

Imagine a web-based banking application (Applications). It runs on a server (Systems) connected to the internet via the bank's network (Networks). The bank has security policies (Policies) in place regarding password strength, access control, and incident response.

Using the bull's-eye model:

1.  The bank would first focus on securing the banking application itself (e.g., secure coding practices, input validation, vulnerability scanning).
2.  Next, they would harden the server's operating system and install necessary security patches.
3.  Then, they would configure firewalls and intrusion detection systems to protect the network.
4.  Finally, they would ensure that their security policies are up-to-date and effectively communicated to employees.

This approach ensures that the most critical asset—the banking application—receives the highest priority in terms of security efforts.
