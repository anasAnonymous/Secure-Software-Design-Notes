Gap analysis is a technique used to determine the difference between a current state (where you are now) and a desired future state (where you want to be). This difference is the "gap," and the analysis helps identify the steps needed to bridge that gap.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1.  **Plan Initiated:** The process begins with establishing a plan that outlines the desired future state.
2.  **Current State Assessed:** The current situation is evaluated and documented. This involves collecting data and information about the current performance, processes, or resources.
3.  **Current State Compared to Desired State as per Plan:** The current state is compared to the desired state defined in the plan. This comparison highlights the discrepancies or gaps.
4.  **Current = Desired?:** A decision point. If the current state matches the desired state, the process moves to monitoring and reassessment.
5.  **Monitor and Periodically Reassess:** If the current state meets the desired state, ongoing monitoring ensures it stays that way. Periodic reassessments are done to confirm continued alignment.
6.  **Develop Gap Analysis Remediation Plan:** If there's a gap (current state â‰  desired state), a plan is created to address the discrepancies. This plan outlines specific actions, resources, and timelines to close the gap.
7.  **Implement Gap Analysis Remediation Plan and Reassess:** The remediation plan is put into action. After implementation, the current state is reassessed to see if the gap has been closed. This step often loops back to the "Current State Assessed" step to begin the comparison process again.

In essence, this is a cyclical process of assessment, comparison, planning, implementation, and reassessment aimed at achieving a desired outcome.



Let's create an example scenario related to information assurance to illustrate the gap analysis process:

**Scenario:** A small business, "Cozy Coffee Shop," wants to improve its information security posture to protect customer data (names, addresses, email addresses, and purchase history) collected through its online ordering system and loyalty program.

**1. Plan Initiated:**

*   **Desired State:** Cozy Coffee Shop aims to comply with basic data protection standards and minimize the risk of data breaches. They want to achieve the following:
    *   Strong passwords for all systems.
    *   Regular software updates on all devices.
    *   Firewall protection for their network.
    *   Employee training on data security best practices.

**2. Current State Assessed:**

*   An IT consultant assesses Cozy Coffee Shop's current security measures and finds the following:
    *   Some employees use weak passwords (e.g., "password123").
    *   Software updates are not performed regularly on all computers.
    *   A basic firewall is in place, but it's not configured optimally.
    *   Employees have not received any formal data security training.

**3. Current State Compared to Desired State as per Plan:**

*   The consultant compares the current state to the desired state and identifies the following gaps:
    *   **Password Strength:** Current passwords do not meet the desired strength requirements.
    *   **Software Updates:** Software is not consistently updated, leaving systems vulnerable.
    *   **Firewall Configuration:** The firewall is not configured for optimal protection.
    *   **Employee Training:** Employees lack awareness of data security best practices.

**4. Current = Desired?:**

*   No, the current state does not equal the desired state. There are significant gaps in password strength, software updates, firewall configuration, and employee training.

**5. Develop Gap Analysis Remediation Plan:**

*   The consultant develops a remediation plan to address the identified gaps:
    *   **Password Policy:** Implement a strong password policy requiring a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Enforce regular password changes.
    *   **Software Update Policy:** Implement a policy for regular software updates on all devices. Automate updates where possible.
    *   **Firewall Configuration:** Reconfigure the firewall to block unnecessary ports and services and enable intrusion detection.
    *   **Employee Training:** Conduct regular training sessions for employees on data security best practices, including password management, phishing awareness, and safe internet use.

**6. Implement Gap Analysis Remediation Plan and Reassess:**

*   Cozy Coffee Shop implements the remediation plan:
    *   They enforce the new password policy, update software on all computers, reconfigure the firewall, and conduct employee training.
*   After implementation, the consultant reassesses the security measures and finds:
    *   All employees now use strong passwords.
    *   Software is being updated regularly.
    *   The firewall is configured optimally.
    *   Employees demonstrate a good understanding of data security best practices.

**7. Monitor and Periodically Reassess:**

*   Cozy Coffee Shop establishes a process for ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment of its security measures to ensure continued compliance with the desired state and adapt to evolving threats.

This example illustrates how gap analysis can be used in information assurance to identify security weaknesses and implement measures to improve an organization's security posture.
