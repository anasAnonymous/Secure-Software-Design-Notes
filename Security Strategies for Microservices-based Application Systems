# Microservices Security Strategies: Comprehensive Notes

## **1. Microservices-Based Application Systems**

### **1.1 Conceptual View**
- Microservices are small, independent entities that implement specific business functions.
- They communicate via APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs) or messaging systems.
- Typically hosted in containers or virtual machines.

**Examples**:
1. A microservice for user authentication that operates independently of other services.
2. An inventory management microservice used by both shipping and billing.

---

### **1.2 Design Principles**
Key drivers include:
- **Autonomy**: Independently deployed and managed.
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimized dependencies.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Designed for recovery.

**Examples**:
1. Stateless services where all sessions are stored in a central cache.
2. Separate scaling of the payment processing service without affecting others.

---

## **2. Threats to Microservices**

### **2.1 Service Discovery Threats**
- Malicious services registering themselves.
- Corruption of the service registry.

**Examples**:
1. An attacker registers a fake service, intercepting data.
2. Registry corruption redirects users to non-functional endpoints.

### **2.2 Internet-Based Attacks**
- Larger attack surface due to multiple endpoints.
- Risks like botnet attacks and direct access bypassing security controls.

**Examples**:
1. A botnet overloads a public-facing API.
2. Skipping security layers by accessing internal microservices directly.

### **2.3 Cascading Failures**
- Dependency between services can lead to chain failures.

**Examples**:
1. Failure of the payment gateway affects order processing.
2. A malfunction in the user profile service halts other dependent services.

## **3. Security Strategies for Core Features**

### **3.1 Identity and Access Management**
- Use authentication tokens (OAuth 2.0, JWT).
- Centralize access policies with an authorization server.

**Examples**:
1. Use of short-lived JWT tokens for API authentication.
2. Role-based access control at an API gateway.

### **3.2 Service Discovery**
- Implement secure registries using HTTPS/TLS.
- Avoid self-registration; use third-party registration.

**Examples**:
1. A service registry accessible only through secure channels.
2. Distributed service registry for large applications.

### **3.3 Secure Communication**
- Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for encryption and authentication.
- Maintain persistent TLS connections for frequently interacting services.

**Examples**:
1. Encrypting data between the API gateway and services.
2. Mutual TLS for authenticating inter-service communication.

---

## **4. Architectural Frameworks**

### **4.1 API Gateway**
- Acts as a single entry point for clients.
- Handles load balancing, caching, and protocol translation.

**Examples**:
1. Aggregating multiple API calls into a single response.
2. Protocol translation between client HTTPS requests and internal gRPC.

### **4.2 Service Mesh**
- Manages service-to-service communication.
- Provides traffic routing, encryption, and monitoring.

**Examples**:
1. Sidecar proxies enabling encrypted communication between services.
2. Traffic shaping using service mesh policies.

---

## **5. Advantages and Disadvantages**

### **5.1 Advantages**
- Scalability: Independent scaling of services.
- Resilience: Contained failures without cascading effects.

**Examples**:
1. Scaling the search service independently during high traffic.
2. Fault-tolerant design of the authentication microservice.

### **5.2 Disadvantages**
- Increased complexity in testing and monitoring.
- Dependency management challenges.

**Examples**:
1. Ensuring all services are operational during integration tests.
2. Handling version compatibility between services.

## **Flashcards**

**1. What is a microservice?**  
Small, independent entities performing specific business functions.  

**2. What is API Gateway?**  
A single entry point that manages API calls, protocol translation, and security.

**3. What are cascading failures?**  
Failures that propagate due to dependency between services.

## **Scenario-Based Questions**

**Q1.** What happens if a service registry is compromised?  
**A1.** Malicious services may register, redirecting communication and compromising security.

**Q2.** How would you ensure secure inter-service communication?  
**A2.** Use mutual TLS and persistent encrypted connections.
